This is the BeanShell adapter for IBM's Bean Scripting Famework.
It is an implementation of the BSFEngine class, allowing BSF aware
applications to use BeanShell as a scripting language.

I believe this implementation is complete (with some hesitation about the
the usefullness of the compileXXX() style methods - provided by the base
utility class).
