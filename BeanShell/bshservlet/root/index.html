<h1>Test BeanShell Servlet</h1>

The BeanShell Test Servlet evaluates the text you submit below and shows
you the output, along with any return value.  It will also capture output sent 
to System.out and System.err.
<p>

Please note the BeanShell version information displayed with the output.
Some app servers (e.g. <b>Weblogic</b>) may come bundled with their own copy
of BeanShell and may use their version even if you packaged a newer release
inside the WAR file.  To upgrade you may have to place the new BeanShell
release earlier in the app server's classpath.  See www.beanshell.org for more 
information.
