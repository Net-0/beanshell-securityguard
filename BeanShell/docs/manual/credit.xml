<name>Credit and Acknowledgments</name>


Many people have contributed substantially to BeanShell, including many
who have contributed ideas, which can be just as important as code.
<p/>
I will try to start listing as many as possible here, but I will forget, 
so please feel free to remind me (don't be modest, everyone who contributes 
deserves to be mentioned).

<h4>Me</h4>

Finally, I will put in a plug for myself.
