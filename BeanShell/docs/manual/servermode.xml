Server mode lets you access a bsh session inside of a remote VM.
You can literally telnet into the application and type commands at the
bsh shell prompt. Or even better you can use your a web browser to bring up a 
remote console. 
<p/>

After starting the bsh server you can connect your web browser to the 
specified port.  
Bsh will act as an httpd and send over a remote console applet.  
You will get a bsh session that looks like the regular console applet, but 
it will be running remotely in the originating VM.  You can open as many
sessions into that VM as you like in this way...
<p/>

Special Notes: 
In server mode bsh actually runs *two* services: a (minimal) httpd at 
the port you specify and a session server at your port + 1.  You can
actually connect to the session server with telnet, if you want to try it
out...(you have to type ";"s  manually at the end of every line).
