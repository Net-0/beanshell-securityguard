<name>Scripting Threads</name>

BeanShell 'This' type references also implement the standard 
java.lang.Runnable interface, so you can declare a "run()" method in your bsh
objects and make it the target of a Thread.

<example>
foo() {
	run() {
		// do work...
	}
	return this;
}

foo = foo();
new Thread( foo ).start();
</example>
<p/>

You can also use the bg() command to run an external script in a separate
thread. example...
