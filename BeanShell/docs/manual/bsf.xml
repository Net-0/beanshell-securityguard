BSF is IBM's "Bean Scripting Framework".  It is generic framework that allows
many scripting languages to be plugged into an application.  It shields
the application from knowledge of how to invoke the scripting languages and
their APIs, via adapter "engines". 
<p/>

BeanShell supports the BSF by providing the necessary adapter.  In theory,
this means that BeanShell can be used as a scripting language for any BSF
capable application simply by dropping the bsh JAR file into the classpath.
In practice however, there is a problem.  BSF does not have a dynamic 
registration mechanism.  So to make new scripting languages
available (such as BeanShell) you have to explicitly register its adapter
in your code.  Here is an example of how to do that:

<example>
import com.ibm.bsf.*;

// register beanshell with the BSF framework
String [] extensions = { "bsh" };
BSFManager.registerScriptingEngine(
    "beanshell", "bsh.util.BeanShellBSFEngine", extensions );
</example>


See <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf">
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf</a> for more 
information about BSF.

<h2>Ant</h2>

Ant 1.5+ has explicit support for BeanShell as a BSF scripting language.
The BeanShell JAR file includes the necessary BSF adapter.  You must
simply specify language="beanshell" in your script tags.

<h3>Installation</h3>

To use BeanShell within Ant you must do two things:
<ol>
<li>Add the
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf">
BSF bsf.jar file</a>
to ANT_HOME/lib or the classpath.</li>
<li>Add the 
<a href="http://www.beanshell.org/download.html">
BeanShell bsh.jar file</a>
to ANT_HOME/lib or the classpath.</li>
</ol>
<p/>

You can then run scripts from a file, or in-line like so:
<p/>

<example><![CDATA[
<project name="testbsh" default="runscript" basedir=".">
    <target name="runscript">

        <!-- Run script from a file -->
        <script language="beanshell" src="myscript.bsh"/>

        <!-- Run script in-line -->
        <script language="beanshell">&lt;![CDATA[
            for(int i=0; i<10; i++ )
                print( "i="+i );
        ]]&gt;</script>

    </target>
</project>
]]></example>
