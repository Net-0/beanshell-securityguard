<h2>Signed Applet</h2>

There are many additional security restrictions on Applets and this limits
what you can do with BeanShell in this mode.  For unrestricted access 
try the signed version of the applet here.  It requires the Java 1.4 plug-in
to function.

<h3>Swing JConsole - Signed Applet</h3>
A Swing enabled JConsole as a signed applet with the Java plug-in 
(or other swing capable browser).  The signed
applet will allow you unrestricted access to your environment through
scripting.
