The BeanShell Applet is primarily for demonstration and educational purposes.
It allows you to experiment with BeanShell live, directly in your web
browser.  In fact, here it is!

<h1>Insert Applet Here</h1>

There are many additional security restrictions on Applets and this limits
what you can do with BeanShell in this mode.  For unrestricted access 
try the signed version of the applet here.  It requires the Java 1.4 plug-in
to function.
