For-loop scoping is as close to Java as possible.  

The for-statement block acts just like the namespace of the containing 
(parent) block except for variables referenced in the forInit area...  
variables which were initialized in the forinit will shadow the parent 
namespace.

So, for example:

  for(i=0; i< 3; i++) {
		a = 42;
  }

  print(a); // 42
  print(i); // Error - undefined

Of course you can have multiple assignments in your forInit

  for( i=0, x=2, y=3; i<3; i++ ) {
	...
  }

and of course they may also be declared with types:

  for( int i=0, int x=2, String s="foo"; i<3; i++ ) {
	...
  }
</pre>
