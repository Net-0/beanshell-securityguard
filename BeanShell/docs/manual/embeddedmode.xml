<name>Embedding BeanShell in Your Application</name>

<br CLEAR="ALL"/>

BeanShell was designed not only as a standalone scripting language - to run
scripts from files or on the command line -  but to be easily embeddable in 
and extensible by your applications.  When we talk about
embedding BeanShell in your application we mean simply that you can use the
BeanShell Interpreter in your own classes, to evaluate scripts and work with
objects dynamically.  
<p/>

There are a number of reasons you might use BeanShell in this way.  Here
are a few:
<p/>

<h3>Highly Customizable Applications</h3>

You can use BeanShell to make your applications highly customizable by users 
without requiring them to compile Java classes or even to know all of the 
Java syntax.  

During development you can use BeanShell to "factor out" volatile or 
environmentally dependent algorithms from your application and leave them 
in the scripting domain while they are under the most intense change.
Later it is easy to move them back into compiled Java if you wish because
BeanShell syntax is Java syntax.
<p/>

<h3>Macros and Evaluation</h3>

BeanShell can be used as a generic language for "macros" or other complex
tasks that must be described by a user of your application.
For example, the popular JEdit Java editor uses 
BeanShell to allow users to implement macros for key bindings.  This gives
user power to customize the behavior of the editor, using as much (or
as little) of the full power of Java as desired.
<p/>

Java with loose variables is a very simple and appealing language; especially
because there is already so much Java out there.  Even a non-programmer
will be familiar with the name "Java" and more inclined to want to work
with it than an arbitrary new language.
<p/>

BeanShell can also be used to perform dynamic evaluation of complex expressions
such as mathematics or computations entered by the user.   Why write an
arithmetic expression parser when you can let your user enter equations using
intermediate variables, operators, and other constructs.  If strict control
is desired, you can generate the script yourself using your own rules, and
still leave the evaluation to BeanShell.

<h3>Simplify Complex Configuration Files</h3>

Many applications use simple Java properties files or XML for the majority
of their runtime configuration.
It is very common in the development of a large applications for configuration
files like this to become increasingly complex.  It can begin in a number
of seemingly harmless ways - with the desire to make "cross references"
inside the config files (XML supports this nicely).  Then comes the desire
to do something like variable substitution - which introduces some new syntax
such as "${variable}" and usually a second pass in the parsing stage.
Usually, at some point, integration with Java forces the introduction of 
class names into the mix.  The configuration files soon want to start
assigning parameters for object construction.  Ultimately what you'll 
discover is that you are creating your own scripting language - and one that
is probably not as easy to read as plain old Java.
<p/>

BeanShell solves the problem of complex configuration files by allowing
users to work not only with simple properties style values 
(loose variable assignment)
but also to have the full power of Java to construct objects, arrays,
perform loops and conditionals, etc.  And as we'll see, BeanShell scripts
can work seamlessly with objects from the application, <b>without</b>
the need to turn them into strings to cross the script boundary.
<p/>


<h2>The BeanShell Core Distribution</h2>

Beanshell is fairly small, even in its most general distribution.  The
full JAR with all utilities weighs in at about 250K.  But BeanShell is
also distributed in a componentized fashion, allowing you to choose to add
only the utilities and other pieces that you need.  The core distribution
includes only the BeanShell interpreter and is currently about 150K.  <em>We
expect this size to drop in the future with improvements in the parser
generator.</em>  Any significant new features will always be provided in
the form of add-on modules, so that the core language can remain small.
<p/>

More and more people are using BeanShell for embedded applications in small
devices.  We have reports of BeanShell running everywhere from palm-tops
to autonomous buoys in the Pacific ocean!


<h2>Calling BeanShell From Java</h2>

Invoking BeanShell from Java is easy.   The first step is to create in
instance of the bsh.Interpreter class.  Then you can use it to evaluate
strings of code, source external scripts.  You can pass your data in to
the Interpreter as ordinary BeanShell variables, using the Interpreter
set() and get() methods.
<p/>

In "QuickStart" we showed a few examples:

<example>
import bsh.Interpreter;

Interpreter i = new Interpreter();  // Construct an interpreter
i.set("foo", 5);                    // Set variables
i.set("date", new Date() ); 

Date date = (Date)i.get("date");    // retrieve a variable

// Eval a statement and get the result
i.eval("bar = foo*10");             
System.out.println( i.get("bar") );

// Source an external script file
i.source("somefile.bsh");
</example>

The default constructor for the Interpreter assumes that it is going to be
used for simple evaluation.  Other constructors allow you to
set up the Interpreter to work with interactive sources including streams
and the GUI console.
<p/>

<h2>eval()</h2>

The Interprete eval() method accepts a script as a string and interprets it,
optionally returning a result.

The string can contain any normal BeanShell script text with any number of 
Java statements.
The Interpreter maintains state over any number of eval() calls, so you can
interpret statements individually or all together.

<note>
It is not necessary to add a trailing ";" semi-colon at the end of the 
evaluated string.  BeanShell always adds one at the end of the string.
</note>

The result of the evaluation of the last statement or expression in the 
evaluated string is returned as the value of the eval().  Primitive types
(e.g int, char, boolean) are returned wrapped in their primitive wrappers
(e.g. Integer, Character, Boolean).
If an evaluation of a statement or expression yields a "void" value; such
as would be the case for something like a for-loop or a void type method
invocation, eval() returns null.
<p/>

<example>
	Object result = i.eval( "long time = 42; new Date( time )" ); // Date
	Object result = i.eval("2*2");  // Integer
</example>

<h2>EvalError</h2>

The bsh.EvalError exception is the general exception type for an error in 
evaluating a BeanShell script.  Subclasses of EvalError - ParseException
and TargetError - indicate the specific conditions where a textual 
parsing error was encountered or where the script itself caused an exception 
to be generated.
<p/>

<example>
try {
	i.eval( script );
} catch ( EvalError e ) {
	// Error evaluating script
}
</example>

You can get the error message, line number and source file of the error
from the EvalError with the following methods:
<p/>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr><td>
String getErrorText() { 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
int getErrorLineNumber() { 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
String getErrorSourceFile() {
</td></tr>
</table>
<p/>

<h3>ParseException</h3>

ParseException extends EvalError and indicates that the exception was 
caused by a syntactic error in reading the script.  The error message will
indicate the cause.

<h3>TargetError</h3>

TargetError extends EvalError and indicates that the exception was 
not related to the evaluation of the script, but caused the by script itself.
For example, the script may have explicitly thrown an exception
or it may have caused an application level exception such as a NullPointer
exception or an ArithmeticException.
<p/>

The TargetError contains the "cause" exception.  You can retrieve it 
with the getTarget() method.

<example>
try {
	i.eval( script );
} catch ( TargetError e ) {
	// The script threw an exception
	Throwable t = e.getTarget();
	print( "Script threw exception: " + t );
} catch ( ParseException e ) {
	// Parsing error
} catch ( EvalError e ) {
	// General Error evaluating script
}
</example>

<h2>source()</h2>

The Interpreter source() method can be used to read a script from an external
file:

<example>
	i.source("myfile.bsh");
</example>

The Interpreter source() method may throw FileNotFoundException and 
IOException in addition to EvalError.  Aside from that source() is simply
and eval() from a file.

<h3>Getting Interfaces from Interpreter</h3>

We've talked about the usefulness of writing scripts that implement
Java interfaces.  By wrapping a script in an interface you can make it
transparent to the rest of your Java code.

As we described in the "Interfaces" section earlier, within the BeanShell 
interpreter scripted objects automatically implement any interface necessary 
when they are passed as arguments to methods requiring them.  
However if you are going to pass a reference outside of BeanShell you may 
have to perform an explicit cast inside the script, to get it to manufacture 
the correct type.
<p/>

The following example scripts a global actionPerformed() method and returns a
reference to itself as an ActionListener type:

<example>
// script the method globally
i.eval( "actionPerformed( e ) { print( e ); }");

// Get a reference to the script object (implementing the interface)
ActionListener scriptedHandler = 
	(ActionListener)i.eval("return (ActionListener)this");

// Use the scripted event handler normally...
new JButton.addActionListener( script );
</example>

Here we have performed the explicit cast in the script as we returned the
reference.  (And of course we could have used the standard Java anonymous
inner class style syntax as well.)
<p/>

An alternative would have been to have used the Interpreter getInterface()
method, which asks explicitly for the global scope to be cast to a specific
type and returned.
The following example fetches a reference to the interpreter global namespace 
and cast it to the specified type of interface type.  

<pre>
	Interpreter interpreter = new Interpreter();
	// define a method called run()
	interpreter.eval("run() { ... }");

	// Fetch a reference to the interpreter as a Runnable
	Runnable runnable =
		(Runnable)interpreter.getInterface( Runnable.class );
</pre>
<p/>

The interface generated is an adapter (as are all interpreted interfaces).  
It does not interfere with other uses of the global scope or other 
references to it.
We should note also that the interpreter does *not* require that any or all 
of the methods of the interface be defined at the time the interface is
generated.  However if you attempt to invoke one that is not defined
you will get a runtime exception.
<p/>
