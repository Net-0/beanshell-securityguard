This is a book about BeanShell. 
BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with 
object scripting language features, written in Java.  BeanShell executes 
standard Java statements and expressions but also extends Java into the 
scripting domain with common scripting language conventions and syntax.

<h2>History</h2>

A long time ago, back in the summer of 1993, while working at Southwestern
Bell Technology Resources, I was completely infatuated with the Tcl/Tk 
scripting language.  At the time I was also playing around a bit with a 
language called Oak written by James Gosling at Sun. 
Little did I know at the time that within just a few years the little Oak 
language would not only sparc a revolution named Java, but that I would be 
writing one of the first books on Java language for O'Reilly &amp; 
Associates and 
creating Java's first scripting language, BeanShell, modeled on the ideas
contained in Tcl.

BeanShell's first public release was not until 1997, but it had been
on my desk in one form or another since the beginning. BeanShell was not 
truly practical until Sun added reflection to the Java language in 
version 1.1.  After that and after having felt its value in helping me create 
examples and snippets for the second edition of my book, I decided to try to 
polish it up and release it.

BeanShell has slowly, but steadily gained popularity since then.  It has
grown in fits and spurts as its contributor's time has allowed.  But recently
BeanShell has seemed to achieve a sort of critical mass.  
BeanShell is distributed with
Emacs as part of the JDE and with Sun Microsystem's NetBeans / Forte for Java
IDEs.  BeanShell is now also bundled by BEA with their Weblogic application 
server.  We've had reports of BeanShell being used everywhere from 
the high energy physics laboratory CERN, to classrooms teaching programming
to nine year olds.  BeanShell sightings have placed it in large financial 
applications all the way down to embedded systems floating in Buoys in the
pacific ocean.   I attribute this success to the power of the open source 
development model and owe many thanks to everyone who has contributed.
